See also: https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013

The program is structured in 3 terms. Here is the content of the program

##Term 1

###The projects of this term are: 

- Detecting lanes on a street
- Detecting other cars
- Classifying traffic signs
- Identifying borders of the road and calculate curvature of the road
- Teach a car how to detect the borders of a road and then steer the car autonomously

###Technologies used: 

Term 1 is completely developed in Python, whereas Term 2 is done in C++. Python libraries and frameworks used: 

- OpenCV (calibrating, distortion, various color spaces, sliding windows, Hough transform, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG))
- TensorFlow convolutional neural networks
- Keras, a framework that sits on top of TensorFlow
- NumPy
- SciKit Learn - used for support vector machines, decision trees and other machine learning algorithms. 
 

##Term 2
I will start term 2 on 20th March 2017

##Term 3
Start date not clear yet.
